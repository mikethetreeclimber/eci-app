## About ECI CRM

ECI CRM is a web application to help planners of the PPL region to help with permissions of a circuit. Work Studio is an application that allows users to plan a circuit but does not provided an intuitive way to make permission attempts.  ECI CRM is hopefully the application that can fill that gap for planners to make the process of planning and permissions a circuit more streamline.
